# OBISClient.jl

A Julia client for OBIS, the Ocean Biodiversity Information System, a programme of the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO. Results come back as typed tables
with a fixed schema, carrying the licence and citation of the dataset each row came from.

!!! note "Not an official OBIS product"
    OBISClient.jl is an independent, community-maintained client. It is not affiliated with,
    endorsed by, or maintained by OBIS, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, or
    UNESCO. The name identifies the service the package connects to; the data, the API and
    the quality control pipeline are the work of OBIS and its nodes.

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("OBISClient")
```

## Quick start

```julia
using OBISClient

recs = OBISClient.occurrence("Abra alba"; limit = 500)

recs.scientificName        # a column
recs.decimalLatitude       # Float64, always
recs.flags                 # a Set{String} per record

OBISClient.licenses(recs)        # may these data be redistributed?
OBISClient.citations(recs)       # how to credit them, access date included
```

Results implement the Tables.jl interface, so `DataFrame(recs)`, `CSV.write("out.csv", recs)`,
Arrow and Parquet all work without the package depending on any of them.

A full session — retrieve, map, group, pivot and test a relationship — is in
[Worked example: killer whales](worked-example.md).

Full docstrings are in the [Public API](api.md) reference. Functions the package uses
internally, and that the schema is built from, are in [Internals](internals.md).

## What the package guarantees

**A stable, typed schema.** OBIS returns only the fields a record has a value for, so the
field set differs from query to query. A result here always has the same columns in the
same order, with concrete types and `missing` for absent values. Darwin Core fields outside
the core schema are preserved per row in an `extra` column.

**Rights that travel with the data.** Every occurrence row carries the licence and citation
of its dataset, and the result records the date it was retrieved — which the OBIS citation
format requires and nothing in the data supplies.

**Access to what the default view omits.** Absence records and records dropped by the
quality pipeline are excluded unless asked for, and the tri-state `absence`, `dropped` and
`event` keywords ask for them.

**A choice between access routes.** A query too large for the API raises an error listing
the alternatives instead of switching routes on its own. The API and the bulk export don't
cover the same records, so the choice is yours to make.

## Read this before analysing anything

Record counts measure sampling effort as much as biology, and the default view of OBIS is
filtered in two directions. [Interpreting OBIS data](interpreting.md) covers the four ways
a correct query becomes a wrong conclusion.

## How this manual was checked

The numbers, field names and error messages here were checked against the live OBIS API,
not copied from its documentation. Where a statement rests on observation rather than on
something OBIS publishes, the text says so.

Output in the examples was pasted back from actual runs. Docstring examples marked
`jldoctest` run on every documentation build. An
[integration suite](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/test/integration/runtests.jl)
and a [link check](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/test/links/runtests.jl)
run weekly against the live API and over every URL in the manual and the docstrings.

The figures come from [`examples/figures.jl`](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/examples/figures.jl)
and [`examples/orcas.jl`](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/examples/orcas.jl),
which query the API when they run. Counts in the figures move as OBIS ingests data.

The repository also carries [`NOTES.md`](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/NOTES.md),
the research notes the package was built from: the endpoint and parameter inventory, the
response shapes, the pagination and error semantics, and which statements are documented
versus observed.

## Scope

The package is a client. It does not model, plot, or ship data. Analysis belongs in
packages built for it, and OBIS records have a DOI and an access date that a frozen copy
inside a package would misreport.

## How to cite

Cite the **datasets you used** — `OBISClient.citations(result)` builds those, with the access
date filled in. See [Licensing and citation](licensing.md). Citing the package does not
replace citing the data.

For the package itself, the repository ships a
[`CITATION.cff`](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/CITATION.cff), which
GitHub's "Cite this repository" button reads, and a
[`CITATION.bib`](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl/blob/main/CITATION.bib):

```bibtex
@software{bertuzzi_obis_jl_2026,
  author  = {Bertuzzi, Dante},
  title   = {{OBISClient.jl}: a {Julia} client for the {Ocean} {Biodiversity}
             {Information} {System}},
  year    = {2026},
  version = {0.1.0},
  url     = {https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/OBISClient.jl},
  note    = {Julia package}
}
```

Cite the version you actually ran. What you get back depends on the release and on the
state of OBIS the day you queried it; the access date on your data citations covers the
second half of that.
