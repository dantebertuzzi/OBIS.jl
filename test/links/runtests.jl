# Link checks against the live web.
#
# Every URL this package puts in front of a reader is verified here: the ones written into
# the README, the manual, the docstrings, the CITATION files and the example scripts, and
# the ones the package assembles at run time from a prefix and an identifier.
#
# The unit suite never leaves the machine, so a link that rots is invisible to it, and the
# integration suite watches the API rather than the prose around it. Two kinds of rot matter
# more than a typo would: a licence URL is what a user follows to decide whether they may
# redistribute a dataset, and the OBIS manual pages carry the data-use conditions the
# package quotes rather than restates.
#
# Like the integration tests, these are not part of the default suite and never run on every
# push. Run them deliberately:
#
#     julia --project=. test/links/runtests.jl
#
# Failures here are external by nature: from a CI runner a single unreachable host is far
# more often a slow server or a rate limit than a dead link, so every URL is retried before
# it is reported, and the scheduled job retries the whole script.
