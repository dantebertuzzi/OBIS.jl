# The request layer.
#
# Two things shape this file. First, network courtesy: OBIS publishes no request quota and
# asks users not to parallelize downloads, so requests are serial, identified, and backed
# off on failure. Second, the API's error reporting: an HTTP 200 can carry a failure in the
# body, and an HTTP 500 can carry a well-formed empty result set, so status alone never
# decides whether a response is usable.
