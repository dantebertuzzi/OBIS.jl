    OBIS

A Julia client for OBIS, the Ocean Biodiversity Information System, a programme of the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO.

Results are Tables.jl tables with a fixed, concretely typed schema, and they carry the
licence and citation of every dataset they draw on together with the date they were
retrieved.

!!! note "Not an official OBIS product"
    This is an independent, community-maintained client. It is not affiliated with,
    endorsed by, or maintained by OBIS, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, or
    UNESCO. The name identifies the service the package connects to.

# Getting started

```julia
using OBIS, DataFrames

recs = OBIS.occurrence("Abra alba"; limit = 1000)
df = DataFrame(recs)

OBIS.licenses(recs)                        # may these data be redistributed?
print(OBIS.citations(recs; format = :text))  # how to credit them
```

# Interpreting the results

Record counts measure sampling effort as much as biology, and the default view of OBIS
excludes two classes of record that change what a result means. See the "Interpreting OBIS
data" section of the documentation, and the disclaimer in [`OBIS_DISCLAIMER`](@ref), before
drawing conclusions.

"""
const OBIS_DISCLAIMER = """
Appropriate caution is necessary in the interpretation of results derived from OBIS. Users
must recognize that the analysis and interpretation of data require background knowledge
and expertise about marine biodiversity (including ecosystems and taxonomy). Users should
be aware of possible errors, including in the use of species names, geo-referencing, data
handling, and mapping. They should cross check their results for possible errors and
qualify their interpretation of any results accordingly.

Unless data are collected through activities funded by IOC/IODE, neither UNESCO, IOC, IODE,
the OBIS Secretariat, nor its employees or contractors, own the data in OBIS and they take
no responsibility for the quality of data or products based on OBIS, or its use or misuse.

# `nrow`, `ncol` and `metadata` are deliberately not exported: DataFrames exports the same
# names through DataAPI, and exporting them here would make `using OBIS, DataFrames` an
# ambiguity error at every call site. Reach them as `OBIS.nrow(t)`, or load the DataFrames
# extension, which makes the DataAPI versions work on an `OBISTable` directly.
