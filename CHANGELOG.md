## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `notebooks/getting-started.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook that runs the client against the live
  API and is linked from the README by a badge that opens it in Google Colab, which supports
  Julia natively. It covers a first query, the result schema, the licences and citations
  carried on a result, the quality flags and what a default query filters out, records per
  year, a scatter of coordinates with the `ON_LAND` records marked, the checklist and taxon
  routes, and `estimate_size` before a large pull. The outputs committed with it were produced
  by an actual run, so the notebook reads on GitHub without being executed.
- `notebooks/obis-missingness.ipynb`, which pairs this client with
  [MissingPatterns.jl](https://github.com/dantebertuzzi/MissingPatterns.jl) to audit what is
  absent from a pull of records: which fields go missing together, what complete-case analysis
  would cost, and how a 3000-record sample compares with OBIS's own per-field counts for the
  whole query. The same notebook is committed in the MissingPatterns.jl repository, since it
  belongs to both packages; the two copies have to be kept in step by hand.
- `notebooks/descriptive-statistics.ipynb`, a descriptive pass over a live pull of Atlantic cod
  records, with CairoMakie figures on the palette `examples/theme.jl` gives the package's own
  maps. It covers position, spread and skew for the numeric columns, the shapes behind those
  numbers, a multimodal temperature distribution resolved into one density per contributing
  dataset, depth as an ECDF split by `basisOfRecord`, frequency tables that keep the absences,
  the count column and why its mean is not one, a Spearman matrix in which the
  latitude-temperature gradient has been erased by pooling two ocean basins, and a comparison of
  the sample against `statistics_env` over the whole query. Plotting stays outside the package:
  the notebook uses CairoMakie on a `DataFrame`, as any caller would.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-07

First release. A Julia client for the OBIS API with a stable typed schema, licence and
citation carried on every result, streaming and resumable pagination, an optional
reproducibility cache, the bulk-export route, and access to the absence and dropped records
a default query leaves out.

Developed before this release under the name `OBIS`, which the General registry does not
accept: a package name must be at least five characters and must not be entirely upper
case, and `OBIS` also sits within Damerau-Levenshtein distance 2 of eleven registered
names. A first attempt at `OceanBIS` cleared those checks but dropped the acronym the
service is actually known by. `OBISClient` follows the registry's own advice on acronyms —
keep the one people search for, and pair it with a word that says what the package is.

Only the package, module and repository changed. `OBISTable` and the `OBIS*` error types
keep their names, since they are named for the service, not for the package.

### Added

- `examples/brazil.jl`, four maps of the Brazilian shelf that are not scatters of one
  query: a choropleth of records and species per one-degree cell built from `statistics`
  alone, without retrieving an occurrence; the same cells with the species–effort relation
  divided out; `Scleractinia` read at the order and at the endemic reef genus `Mussismilia`,
  which answer different questions about where the reefs are; and sharks and rays coloured
  by the seabed depth under them, with a marginal showing that 77% sit over water shallower
  than 200 m. The script caches every response, so a re-run rebuilds the same figures from
  the same responses.
- `Palette` gains `landfill` and the `seq` and `div` value scales the new maps need: one
  hue for magnitude, two hues around a neutral grey for polarity, each stepped separately
  for the light and dark surfaces and checked for lightness monotonicity.
- A link check (`test/links/runtests.jl`) over every URL in the README, the manual, the
  docstrings, the CITATION files and the example scripts, and over the ones the package
  builds at run time from a prefix and an identifier. It runs weekly alongside the
  integration suite, never on every push.
- `OBISClient.DOWNLOADER`, a swappable seam for the bulk-export download, matching
  `OBISClient.TRANSPORT` on the request path. The export route is now testable without reaching
  the bucket; the default behaviour is unchanged.
- `OBISClient.read_export`, which reads the bulk GeoParquet export into the same canonical schema
  an API query returns — so `licenses`, `citations`, `DataFrame` and everything else
  downstream work on the bulk route too. It lives in a package extension on DuckDB, which is
  therefore installed only by users who take that route. `absence` and `dropped` default to
  `:exclude`, matching the API, and the access date on the result is the file's date rather
  than today.
- Occurrence queries with the full filter set: taxon name and AphiaID, WKT geometry, date
  and depth ranges, dataset, node, institute and area identifiers, quality flags, and the
  measurement and extension filters.
- Tri-state `absence`, `dropped` and `event` selection, giving access to absence records
  and to records the quality pipeline dropped.
- A canonical typed schema with a fixed column set per endpoint, concrete element types,
  and non-core Darwin Core fields preserved per row in an `extra` column.
- Licence and citation joined onto every occurrence row, with the access date recorded at
  request time; `licenses` and `citations`, the latter in table, text and BibTeX form.
- Tables.jl interface on results, with an optional DataFrames extension that flattens the
  `extra` column and extends the DataAPI `nrow`/`ncol` generics.
- Lazy, resumable pagination through `occurrence_pages`, with an optional progress
  indicator and a cursor that serializes to a single string.
- An optional local cache addressed by query hash, storing raw responses with their
  retrieval date, and a read-only mode that refuses to fall back to the network.
- A query-size guard that estimates a query through `/statistics` and raises rather than
  switching access routes silently.
- The bulk export route: per-dataset GeoParquet downloads, the export licence table, and
  `export_covers` to report which queries the export cannot serve.
- The remaining endpoints: taxon, checklist, dataset, node, institute, area, country,
  facet, statistics and metrics.
- Client-side validation of geometry, dates, depths, identifiers, page sizes, field lists
  and quality flags, with errors that name the fix.
- Serial requests with an identifying `User-Agent`, exponential backoff on 429 and 5xx,
  and `Retry-After` support.
- A worked example on killer whales — retrieval, `groupby`, `unstack`, global and regional
  maps, and a test of whether apparent species richness tracks sampling effort across large
  marine ecosystems — as `examples/orcas.jl` and a manual page built from its output.
- Figures in the README and the manual, generated from live queries by `examples/figures.jl`
  and `examples/orcas.jl`. Plotting stays out of the package: CairoMakie, GeoMakie,
  NaturalEarth and DataFrames belong to the `examples/` environment only.
- An "Example scripts" page carrying both scripts in full, generated from the files at
  build time so it cannot drift from them.
- A `CITATION.bib` alongside `CITATION.cff`.
- Licence handling that treats an unidentified rights statement as requiring attribution
  and as not permitting redistribution, rather than assuming a permissive default.
- A manual organized around a table mapping each function to what it returns and where it
  is explained, with the reference split into a public API and an internals page, and
  `checkdocs = :all` so every docstring has to be reachable from it.
- `export_covers` reports the bulk export as covering `absence` and `dropped` selections,
  contrary to the OBIS data access page. Across five datasets the export's `absence` and
  `dropped` row counts matched the API's `absence = :only` and `dropped = :only` counts
  exactly, and each export's total came to the default count plus them, so
  `download_exports` serves those queries and the large-query error offers the export route
  for them. Only a pure `event` selection is API-only — the export has no column
  identifying those records.
